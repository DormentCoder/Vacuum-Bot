# vacuum
Run the game using: __python3 game.py__

Your job is to write code that controls the Vacuum agent.

To do that, your code needs to specify a value for the function makeMove() in vacuum.py to return. The legal values for
makeMove() to return and found in the Action enum within the utils.py file.


The rest of the files are as follows:

- dirtyEnvironment.py: draws the environment on the screen.
- game.py: runs the game.
- graphics.py: simple Python graphics.
- utils.py: utilities used in a few places.
- world.py: keeps track of everything (all the agents).
